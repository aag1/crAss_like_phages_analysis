# Analysis of crAss-like phages in LLD, LLD follow-up, 300OB and IBD cohorts

* __crAss_contigs_detection__ -- search for crAss-like contigs & delineate vOTUs

* __genus_level_clusters__ -- delineate genus-level clusters

* __build_tree__ -- build TerL-based and portal-based phylogenetic trees

* __nt_content__ -- calculate nucleotide content and GC skew of crAss-like genomes

* __genome_maps__ -- annotate crAss-like genomes

* __map_reads__ -- map reads to crAss-like genomes

* __RNAp_recombination__ -- explore the read coverage anomaly

* __crAss_hosts__ -- predict hosts of crAss-like phages

* __crAss_stability__ -- explore stability of crAss-like phages over a 4-year period

* __LLD_pheno_assoc__ -- explore associations with LLD phenotypes

* __IBD_300OB_pheno_assoc__ -- explore associations with obesity and IBD
